            <h2>About the hair</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the series, Zuko has a distinctive tail known as a <strong>'sikha.'</strong>  The sikha represents the spiritual connection and obedience of firebenders to the Fire Lord and their national identity. Zuko's sikha is an important symbol of his loyalty to the Fire Nation and his desire to find the Avatar, Aang, in order to restore honor to his family and himself.</p>
            <h2>About the outfit</h2>
            <p>Tijdens zijn ballingschap in de Aardekoninkrijk-stad Ba Sing Se draagt Zuko een eenvoudiger en casual outfit, zonder zijn topknoop. Deze outfit vertegenwoordigt zijn tijdelijke breuk met de Vuurnatie en zijn zoektocht naar een nieuw leven.</p>
